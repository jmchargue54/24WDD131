    <h2>Jenna McHargue</h2>
    <p>Hello! This is my fourth semester here ar BYUI although I graduated high school with my associates degree so now I'm working on my bachelors in web design and developlement.</p>
    <p>I am from Moses Lake, a beautiful area in the middle of Washington state. I am the oldest of four children whith three girls and the youngest a boy. I showed pigs for ten years with my cousins. It was fun and a learning experience to go back in forth winning at the different fairs. Now I get to help and watch my siblings show pigs and other animals as well.</p>
    <p>I enjoy fishing, reading, doing puzzles, skiing, and much more.</p>
