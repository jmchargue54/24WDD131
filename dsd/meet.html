            <h2>Dr. Ron McHargue</h2>
            <h3>Dentist</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Moses Lake, so coming home to care for the people and community I know so well was natural for me. My parents owned B & S small engine repair, so every day after school you could find me there, working alongside my father and helping the family run the business. After graduating Moses Lake High School, I attended Big Bend community College where I met my beautiful wife, Lacey. I then transferred to Washington State University to complete my undergraduate degree, followed by the move to the big city of Seattle to attend the University of Washington School of Dentistry, one of the top ranked dental schools in the nation. I chose the career of dentistry because it combines my love of the sciences, my ability to work well with my hands and my desire to work with people. I love how technical dentistry is and how it challenges me, not to mention the feeling I get when I am able to help someone get out of pain or improve their life by giving them a beautiful smile. I was one of nine students hand picked to pilot a new program called R.I.D.E that allowed me to gain some practical experience working in clinics for the six months before I graduated. I was lucky enough to be able to do that here at the Moses Lake Community Health Center, giving me a great jump start and helping me to graduate with about 3 times as much clinical experience as a normal dental student. Since graduating I worked for a short time at the Community Health Center and Job Corp. I am so happy to be back in my hometown and look forward to meeting you. I am lucky enough to be married to my wife, Lacey, for 16 years and have three beautiful little girls and one rowdy boy. In my free time I enjoy spending time with family, running, basketball and thinking of fun things to keep my family entertained.</p>
